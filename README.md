# clojure-fractal

Small project for drawing Fractals with Clojure.

## Usage

Run in your shell:

    lein deps && lein install && lein repl
   
Run in your repl:

    (use 'clojure-fractal.core)
   
    (start fractal)

(Periodically, run in your repl:)

    (draw fractal)

## TODO

1. `(export fractal)` to export an image of your fractal
2. Pre-defined bits of functions that a non-mathematician can compose and put
together to form their own formulae for their fractals
